Kolmogorov Phasescreen Simulation:

This repo includes a program to simulate the optical propagation of wavefronts through a turbulent atmosphere characterized by the
Fried parameter (r0), typically output by Adaptive Optics (AO) systems in telescopes. The generated phasescreens can be paired with
blind-deconvolution algorithms (e.g. Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution) to reverse atmospheric straylight contamination in ground-based 
spectropolarimetric data.
